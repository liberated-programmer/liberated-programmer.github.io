                Look Busy is a Chrome extension that helps you
                look like you are working when you really aren't.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you ever need to quickly escape a website you're on and look like you
                are doing something productive, then Look Busy is the extension for you!
                While on any website, simply press your escape key and Look Busy will
                redirect you to a different website that will make you look like you are
                hard at work at work at whatever subject you choose.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would later like to return to the page that you were on before,
                hold down your shift key and press your home key.
            </p>
